<p>Hi, My name is Alannah Smith. I gained interest in programming in 2018. I went to my local college to get into the tranfer
   program
  However, fate had other plans; to this day I cant recall exactly what lead to me enrolling for my current degree in
  that office but I am grateful. I now have an Associates Degree in Mobile Applicaion Development. the Idea of creating 
  and problem solving had me imidietly captivated.
  I am experienced with HTML, CSS, Javascript, python and Java. I am also well versed in the content management systems WordPress and Wix. 
  The efficiecncy and creativity are what I love so much about coding. I am eager to learn more and push the limits of what can be achieved. </p>
